# Sampling Assignment

## Objective
To analyze how different sampling techniques affect the performance of ML models on imbalanced dataset.

## Dataset
Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset

## Steps Performed
- Converted dataset into balanced dataset
- Created five samples
- Applied five sampling techniques:
  - RandomOverSampler
  - RandomUnderSampler
  - SMOTE
  - ADASYN
  - NearMiss
- Applied five ML models:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Tree
  - KNN
  - Random Forest
  - SVM
- Compared accuracy results
- Determined best sampling technique per model

## Conclusion
Different sampling techniques affect different models differently. Oversampling methods like SMOTE generally performed better compared to undersampling methods.
